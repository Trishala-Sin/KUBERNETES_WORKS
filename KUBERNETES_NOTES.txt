Kubernetes Notes: 

With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, 
and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. 
Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to 
be released and updated without downtime. 
Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized applications run where and when you want, 
and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work. Kubernetes is a production-ready, 
open source platform designed with Google's accumulated experience in container orchestration, 
combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.



manage a simple cluster and its containerized applications : 
*	Deploy a containerized application on a cluster.
*	Scale the deployment.
*	Update the containerized application with a new software version.
*	Debug the containerized application.

A Kubernetes Pod is a group of one or more Containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking. 
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
